# Oh_Crack
This repo documents my demo project during my Insight program. 
Oh_Crack is a deep-learning based program that automatically detect the types of the crack commonly found on the road. It aims to reduce the amount of time in handling the complaint. 

Oh_Crack was developed on Python 3.6.
To install all related dependencies:
pip install -r requirement.txt

The crack detection consists of two parts, crack detection and recognitiom. A pre-trained RetinaNet model in Keras has been used to detect the cracks using transfer learning.
